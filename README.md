# LOG-680 : Template for Oxygen-CS

![image](./doc/wheel.png)

This Python application continuously monitors a sensor hub and manages HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system actions based on received sensor data.

It leverages `signalrcore` to maintain a real-time connection to the sensor hub and utilizes `requests` to send GET requests to a remote HVAC control endpoint.

This application uses `pipenv`, a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world.

## Requierements

- Python 3.8+
- pipenv

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/MarioGith/log680.git
cd log680
```

2. Install the project's dependencies :

```
pipenv install
```

## Setup

You need to setup the following variables inside the Main class:

- HOST: The host of the sensor hub and HVAC system.
- TOKEN: The token for authenticating requests.
- TICKETS: The number of tickets.
- T_MAX: The maximum allowed temperature.
- T_MIN: The minimum allowed temperature.
- DATABASE: The database connection details.

## Running the Program

After setup, you can start the program with the following command:

```
pipenv run strart
```

## Logging

The application logs important events such as connection open/close and error events to help in troubleshooting.

## To Implement

There are placeholders in the code for sending events to a database and handling request exceptions. These sections should be completed as per the requirements of your specific application.
